# secret-santa

A Rails 5 app built in a night for the office secret Santa gift exchange.

Participants register and then draw names out of the hat, like you'd expect.

## Setup

Create your own versions of the `application.yml` and `database.yml` files.

In the `application.yml` file, specify the number of participants which the system should expect.
